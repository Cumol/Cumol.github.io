      <description>Note: This is my first attempt of a detailed literature review for &amp;ldquo;not-only&amp;rdquo; scientists. The idea is, instead of &amp;ldquo;dumbing down&amp;rdquo; science to a point it is far from true, I will attempt to explain as much as I see necessary. The hope is that the dissection of the articles into easily-understandable pieces will allow a deeper understanding of the subject. I will mainly focus on neuroscience/biology articles surrounding psychedelics, as this is a subject I, and many others, find interesting.</description>
